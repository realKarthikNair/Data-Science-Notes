# Learning-Numpy

Sharing the notes I'm making while learning Numpy :-)

I'll be updating the Jupyter Notebook as well as the .py and PDF exports of it here while i progress through the same

The Jupyter Notebook file is meant to be downloaded and run on your local machine rather than here at Github since Github is truncating words from the end of the screen from the file due to rendering issues.

**It is recommended to use the PDF file if for some reason you can't/don't want to install Jupyter Notebook**

**Github in some pages is rendering the PDF file weirdly, Just download and open it on your local machine to solve that!**
